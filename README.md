The project is implemented in accordance with the procedural programming paradigm. Created sorted containers to avoid duplicates. The first one is for user input, which is checked by the try and catch exception handler for correct data type and scope. Then, using the random number generator function, numbers from the appropriate range are drawn. Duplicates are automatically discarded from the container. A separate function compares both containers and awards points if the user guesses the number correctly.
